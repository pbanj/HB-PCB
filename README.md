# Pbanjs Console Mod & Repair Practice Board

An actually useful learn to solder board that lets you get a feel for what itâ€™s like to work on modding and repairing consoles.

- It has a little bit of everything you might run into while repairing or modifying a console.
- All surface mount components have a second set of pads so you can check for shorts/bridges.
- You can destroy this instead of your console.

My plan is to put this up on something like https://www.crowdsupply.com/ I don't really care about the profit; this is for the community. So that would allow the lowest cost. 

- I'd like to have 300 of them made. 
- I'd like to do it bundled with some supplies, like some solder, some wick, some flux, some wire. I have most of that already as I've been working on this for a while now. The supplies are stuff I use, not just some random crap off amazon. Gotta have good supplies if you want good results.
- I'll be handling the shipping to keep the price low. I already ship stuff all the time, so I have boxes and what not.
- They will come assembled with everything on them soldered in place. You'd have to remove the component when replacing it.
- Once the first batch is done and out there, all the source for it will be released not just the Gerbers. Open source hardware isn't really open source if all you supply is Gerbers.
- I'm debating hand assembling them to help keep costs low, or partially assembled at fab and partially hand assembled them.
